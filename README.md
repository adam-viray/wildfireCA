# wildfireCA
Everything to get started is here. The file CA_incident.py is the script which can run one or more incidents, assuming the data is prepared correctly.
In main, simply change dirs to a list containing the paths to the data folders. In this case, it will just be "wherever_you_clone_this_repo/data".
Then just run the script and it should create an output folder with a bunch of pngs and a gif. The model parameters can be changed in the file settings.txt.
