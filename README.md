# wildfireCA
Everything to get started is here. The file CA_incident.py is the script which can run one or more incidents, assuming the data is prepared correctly.
In main, simply change dirs to a list containing the paths to the data folders. To run the test example, change nothing.
When you run the script  it should create an output folder with a bunch of pngs and a gif. The model parameters can be changed in the file settings.txt.
